# SUMMARY #
I have a diverse background in applications and networking.  I have always looked to grow and expand technology bases by focusing on the business problem and solving through technologies.  Over 20 years in technology was spent learning, developing and expanding many areas of technology.  I worked as a tactical problem solver in IT, to customer sales through to solutions architecture.  
Shifts in technology have driven greater interest in those technology growth phases such as the transition of voice from TDM, to ATM/Frame, and on to IP.  Next I focused on enabling the shift of video from traditional MPEG technologies to Adaptive bit rate technologies and scaling those environments leveraging CDN technologies.  Current focus area is on Data Center technologies; Cloud Management systems, SDN models, automation, orchestration forwarding plane performance, application dependency graphs.   These technologies all play back to network carrier's core business of networking and helping them monetize their network while reducing their operations cost.  
I love the chance to learn and educate.  Success for me is driving the technology decision that solves the business problems.  One product rarely solves the problem.  I enjoy driving a multi-product strategy to address customer needs.  I am very interested in driving change into these service providers as they adapt to new operational models.  Driving change and customer adoption of new technologies excites me.

### Technology areas of interest ###
- **Server technology transformation** - Segment routing and MPLS is coming closer and closer to the host layer.
- **Network Analytics** - Playing a larger role, than every before; trends in security and application dependency tracing
- **Scaling VNFs** - new horizontal scaling with highly stateful workloads are very interesting.  Coupled with both the above there is a lot of power there
- **Automation & Orchestration** - This is the foundation upon all the rest NEED to be built upon.

### 1. Fork the Beautiful Jekyll repository

Fork the [repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner in GitHub.

### 2. Rename the repository to `yourusername.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at http://yourusername.github.io (sometimes it takes a few minutes).

### 3. Customize settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site.  The settings in the file are fairly self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you further.  Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated at `yourusername.github.io` within a minute.

You can now visit your shiny new website, which will be seeded with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages.

See how easy that is? I wasn't lying - it really can be done in two minutes.
